Forked to try Telegram bot functionality and also add some more functionalities to basic repository.

# Telegram-bot-Admin

Simple Telegram bot to admin chats.

## Installation and configuration

First of all you need to talk to BotFather as described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

Add your API token to `env` file, for example `config.env` as:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_token"
```
And run shell command `source config.env` to make that environmental variable available for `config.py` script.
